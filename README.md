## 1. Design accessibility
Accessibility in web or UI/UX design means creating digital interfaces (websites, apps, software) that can be used by all people, including those with disabilities or limitations â€” such as visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments.

It ensures that everyone can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with digital content effectively, regardless of their physical or mental abilities or the devices they use.
