# Thinking In UI/UX Design

## 1. Design accessibility

Accessibility in web or UI/UX design means creating digital interfaces (websites, apps, software) that can be used by all people, including those with disabilities or limitations â€” such as visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments.

It ensures that everyone can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with digital content effectively, regardless of their physical or mental abilities or the devices they use.

## 3. Design Consistency

Design consistency in UI/UX refers to maintaining a uniform look, behavior, and experience across all parts of a product or system. It helps users feel comfortable, confident, and in control because they can predict how the interface will behave based on previous interactions.

## 4. Website Structure

### 4.1 Sitemap

The first thing went we create a website structure is to create a sitemap.The goal of a sitemap is to map out all the different pages and sections of a website, showing how they are organized and linked together. This helps in planning the website's structure, navigation, and content hierarchy.

### 4.2 Wireframe

A wireframe is a low-fidelity visual representation of a website or application's layout and structure. It serves as a blueprint for the design, focusing on the placement of elements like headers, footers, navigation menus, content areas, and interactive components without getting into detailed design aspects like colors or images.
